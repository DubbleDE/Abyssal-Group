MarketBot will respond to the following commands:


    /price item-name [/r region-name] - Fetch the lowest and average prices for an item, both buy and sell orders.
    /sell item-name [/r region-name] [/l limit] - Fetch the cheapest market sell orders for an item.
    /buy item-name [/r region-name] [/l limit] - Fetch the highest market buy orders for an item.
    /data - Show the top searched items
    /info - Print a message with usage information



The item name does not have to be 100% accurate, MarketBot can "guess" which item you meant from part of the word. For example:
(First part of the word) "trit" -> Tritanium
(Last part of the word) "fessor" -> Confessor
(Some parts of the word) "cane fleet" -> Hurricane Fleet Issue
(Spelling mistakes) "backinbaw" -> Mackinaw
